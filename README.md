# AutoCCompiler
An automatic C compiler for Linux, so you can save yourself a headache and some typing. 
Uses Python v3, so please use the command "python3" and make sure you have the latest version of Python 3 installed to use this program. 
If something doesn't work, let me know. If you have any improvements, let me know as well. I can be reached at cbrookmyer@yahoo.com. 
This is my first program, so this is mostly for experience with working with GitHub and (hopefully) other people. I look forward to making new friends.
